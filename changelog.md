* Irrigation
    * Sprinklers! Sprinklers can be crafted in order to irrigate crops (6 block radius for the regular and 12 blocks for the high pressure one)
    * Sprinklers need to be fed with water or treated water in order to function. The water can be inputed and output on the bottom part of the block using a hammer (to configure input or output) and pipes
    * Water tiles only irrigate the adjacent farmland tiles
* Crop disease
    * Crops can become sick and will contaminate adjacent crops and eventually die
    * Using treated water in the sprinklers will prevent and cure diseases
* Farmland
    * Farmland can no longer be trampled by jumping on it
    * Bone meal can no longer be used on crops
    * Tilling dirt now requires several clicks (but better hoes speed up this process)
