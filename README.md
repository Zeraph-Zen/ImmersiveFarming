# Description

Immersive Farming is an addon for Immersive Engineering focusing on improving the farming experience. Players will be able to craft sprinklers, to better irrigate their crops and make pesticides to prevent their crops from getting sick and dying. Immersive Farming also introduces several new mechanics that change vanilla farming.

Thanks to Peter for creating the assets !

# Features

Features are explained in the engineer's manual, but here is an overview:

* Irrigation
  * Sprinklers! Sprinklers can be crafted in order to irrigate crops (6 block radius for the regular and 12 blocks for the high pressure one)
  * Water tiles only irrigate the adjacent farmland tiles
* Carts
  * Plow: to till land faster
  * Sowing machine: to sow seeds and fertilize faster
* Fertilization
  * Compost can be made from the Industrial Composter multiblock
  * Using compost on soil boosts crop growth
* Farmland
  * Farmland can no longer be trampled by jumping on it
  * Bone meal can no longer be used on crops
  * Tilling dirt now requires several clicks (but better hoes speed up this process)
* Crop disease
  * Crops can become sick and will contaminate adjacent crops and eventually die
  * Using treated water in the sprinklers will prevent and cure diseases
